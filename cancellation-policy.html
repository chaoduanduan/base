            Cancellation Policy

Renter cancellation
Renters may cancel their trip through our site or mobile app, and the cancellation is effective immediately. The total amount refunded will depend on when the renter cancels the trip, and varies by fee component (Rental Price, Rental Fee, Protection Fee, and if applicable, Young Driver fee). 
There are no credits/refunds issued for early returns.

Renters will receive a full refund if they cancel before the owner approves the pending trip.
The Rental Fee is non-refundable once an hour has elapsed from the time the trip is booked (i.e., when the owner approves the pending trip).

Protection Fee
The Protection Fee is fully refunded if the trip is cancelled before it starts.

Young Driver Fee
The Young Driver Fee is fully refunded if the trip is cancelled before it starts.

Owner Cancellation
If an owner wishes to cancel a booked trip, they must notify the renter via on-site messaging at least 72 hours in advance, and process the cancellation through the Angel Technology Auto Services Corporation website or mobile app. The cancellation is effective immediately, and the renter receives a complete refund. Renters are counting on owners to provide the car, so repeated cancellations will subject the owner to removal from the marketplace.
Cancelling a rental within 72 hours of the start of a trip will subject the owner to a minimum $50 fine and potential removal from the marketplace.
