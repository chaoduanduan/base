Information We Collect through the Marketplace
As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number). Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when that information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Angel Technology Auto Services Corporation marketplace or about a group or category of products, services or users, if all personal information has been removed.

When you offer your car for rent through the Angel Technology Auto Services Corporation marketplace, we will ask you for certain personal information including your name, contact information and information about your car. We may also require additional financial information from you to facilitate payment to you and to process any filings required by applicable tax authorities. When you rent a car through the Angel Technology Auto Services Corporation marketplace, we will ask you for your name, contact information, payment information and information concerning your driver’s license and driver’s record. We will maintain records for a reasonable period concerning your registration with and use of the Auto Technology Auto Services Corporation marketplace, including any correspondence you have with us.

We automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also know as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the site or in emails relating to the site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the site. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information.
